# Networking in Godot prototype

### Contains a first person 3D networking structure that allows up to 400 clients to connect to a dedicated server.  

This repositories purpose is for me to learn more about networking in game engines other than Unreal Engine. Feel free to browse around in it, it has replicated movement, rotations, and supports real time joining and leaving. The server is able to communicate to the clients using a console, which allows for passing commands etc. to the players.

Disclaimer: I haven't tested the limits of the performance.
