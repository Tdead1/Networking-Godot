# Networking in Godot prototype

### Contains a first person 3D networking structure that allows clients to connect to a seperate dedicated server executable.  

This repositories purpose is for me to learn more about networking in game engines other than Unreal Engine. Feel free to browse around in it, it has replicated movement, rotations, and supports real time joining and leaving. The server is able to communicate to the clients using a console, which allows for passing commands etc. to the players.

Disclaimer: I haven't tested the limits of the performance.

Update the Client.bat and Server.bat with the right paths for starting and removing instances of clients (or the server) seperate from the engine on windows.
